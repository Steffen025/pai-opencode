## 🎉 PAI-OpenCode v0.7.0 Released - Plugin Adapter Complete!

Hey PAI community!

Excited to share that **PAI-OpenCode v0.7.0** is now live with a fully working Plugin Adapter system. All 4 core tests are passing:

| Test | Status |
|------|--------|
| Plugin Load | ✅ |
| Context Injection | ✅ |
| Security Blocking | ✅ |
| Logging | ✅ |

### What's New

**🛡️ Security Blocking Works!**
Dangerous commands like `rm -rf ../` are now blocked before execution. The security validator catches destructive patterns and throws an error to stop them.

**📄 Context Injection**
The CORE skill is automatically injected at session start via `experimental.chat.system.transform`. Your AI knows who it is from the first message.

**📝 TUI-Safe Logging**
All plugin logs go to `/tmp/pai-opencode-debug.log` - no more TUI corruption from console output.

### Key Technical Discovery

While debugging, we discovered an important OpenCode API quirk that might help others building plugins:

```typescript
// In tool.execute.before, args are in OUTPUT, not input!
"tool.execute.before": async (input, output) => {
  const command = output.args.command; // ← Correct!
  // NOT: input.args.command  ← Wrong!
}
```

This is now documented in our `TEST-RESULTS-v0.7.md` for future reference.

### What's Next

- **v0.8** - Converter Tool (automatic PAI→OpenCode translation)
- **v0.9** - Integration Testing + Documentation
- **v1.0** - Public Release

### Links

- **PR:** https://github.com/Steffen025/pai-opencode/pull/3
- **CHANGELOG:** https://github.com/Steffen025/pai-opencode/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md

Thanks to everyone following along! The port is progressing well - we're 7 milestones into the journey to v1.0.
